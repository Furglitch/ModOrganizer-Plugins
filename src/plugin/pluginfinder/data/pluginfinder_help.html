    <div id="PluginIssue">
        <h2>A plugin installed through Plugin Finder does not work.</h2>
        <p>Plugins listed on Plugin Finder are manintained by their separate authors. If you have issues with a plugin,
            please check the documentation, Github and/or Nexus pages for the plugin.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="PluginUpdate">
        <h2>A plugin listed in Plugin Finder is out of date.</h2>
        <p>Plugins listed on Plugin Finder are manintained by their separate authors. Please contact the author of the
            plugin and request they update their data for Plugin Finder.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="ManualUpdate">
        <h2>A plugin I installed manually isn't listed as the correct version.</h2>
        <p>Plugin Finder attempts to detect the version based on the contents of the plugin, but this may not always be
            successful. When this fails, a default version number is given to the plugin. To remedy this, install or
            update the plugin through Plugin Finder.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="UpdateFail">
        <h2>Updating or uninstalling a specific plugin always fails.</h2>
        <p>Even if a message is logged in Mod Organizer that a file could not be moved/deleted, Plugin Finder will still attempt to move/delete those files when Mod Organizer restarts.</p>
        <p>Sometimes current plugin files are locked or marked as read-only, to resolve this issue you will need to manually delete the current plugin from Mod Organizer's plugins folder.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="PluginMissing">
        <h2>My plugin isn't listed in Plugin Finder.</h2>
        <p>If you have a plugin that you would like to add to Plugin Finder, you will need to create a manifest file and host it on the Github for your plugin.</p>
        <p>A generator to help generate a manifest can be accessed here: <br/>
            <code>https://kezyma.github.io/?p=pluginfinder-generator</code></p>
        <p>Once your manifest is on Github, you will need to open a pull request to add your plugin to the directory here: <br/>
            <code>https://github.com/Kezyma/ModOrganizer-Plugins/blob/main/directory/plugin_directory.json</code></p>
        <p>When your pull request is approved, your plugin will appear in Plugin Finder.</p>
