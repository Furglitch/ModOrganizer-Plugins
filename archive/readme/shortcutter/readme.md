## Shortcutter
Shortcutter is a plugin for Mod Organizer 2, allowing users to create instance and profile specific desktop shortcuts to quickly launch apps through Mod Organizer.

Some of the things you can do with Shortcutter:
- Create profile specific shortcuts to launch apps through Mod Organizer with a specific profile.
