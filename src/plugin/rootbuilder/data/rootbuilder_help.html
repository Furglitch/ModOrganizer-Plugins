        <h2>Game files are being copied to the overwrite folder.</h2>
        <p>Root Builder uses Mod Organizer to detect when a game has updated and to rebuild the backup and cache when this happens. This does not work with all games and therefore Root Builder can sometimes believe game updates are actually mod files.</p>
        <p>To resolve this and manually update your backup and cache, do the following;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the Actions tab, click the Delete button next to both Backup and Cache.</li>
            <li>Re-run your game update, since Root Builder will have restored it to the previous version.</li>
            <li>In the Actions tab, click the Create button next to both Backup and Cache.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Running a Build, Sync or Clear is slow or freezes Mod Organizer.</h2>
        <p>Root Builder can become slow to run if it has to process a large number of files or large individual files. There are a few ways to improve performance for builds;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check mods with Root folders for files that aren't required, such as source code or documentation and either remove it or add it to Exclusions (The Data panel on the right side of Mod Organizer can help with seeing exactly which files are in Root folders currently).</li>
            <li>Add large game files to Exclusions. If a game file or folder is never going to be modified, it's safe to add it to Root Builder's exclusions, which will skip it and save time.</li>
            <li>Disasble Hash in the Settings tab. Hashing is more accurate than comparing file size and modified time, but it is also slower.</li>
            <li>Disable Backup, assuming no game files are likely to change as a result of mods, disabling Backup can improve performance on the first Build. Using Exclusions to improve backup speed is preferred though.</li>
        </ul>
