        <h2>The last change made is not synchronising to other profiles.</h2>
        <p>Profile Sync runs on a few specific events, when a mod is installed, removed, enabled/disabled or reordered
            through drag and drop. If another action causes a change, it may not trigger a sync. To ensure one is
            triggered, siwtching the enabled state of a mod back and forth once should solve the issue.</p>
