## Profile Sync
Profile Sync is a plugin for Mod Organizer 2, it allows you to maintain the same mod order (while keeping the enabled/disabled state) across multiple profiles.

Some of the things you can do with Profile Sync:
- Keep your mod order synchronised across multiple profiles.
- Create multiple sync groups to have different sets of profiles with different mod orders.
- Exclude individual profiles that you want to customise and test.
- Save time arranging the same mod in every profile each time you install a new one.
